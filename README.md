# Basic calculator based on ANTLR

Implementation of grammar and use of parser is based on examples from
[The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/the-definitive-antlr-4-reference).


It defines grammar for very simple calculator - integers only with addition and
multiplication. To run the calculator you should have ANTLR4 and .NET installed. After that you
can run

```
./updateGrammar
```

to generate C# classes based on the grammar in `Calc.g4`. To run the calculator
run

```
cd calcApp
dotnet build
dotnet run ./bin/Debug/net6.0/calcApp "123 + 23 * 5    + 321"
```

The project uses newly realised .NET 6.0.

It suppose to be just an example how to use classes generated by ANTLR via
visitor and listeners.
